# Customer-Churn-Analysis-BCG

# BCG Data Science Virtual Experience Program – Customer Churn Analysis

## Overview

This project was completed as part of the **Boston Consulting Group (BCG) Data Science Job Simulation** hosted by **Forage**. The objective was to conduct a comprehensive **customer churn analysis** using real-world-inspired data, and deliver actionable insights to reduce churn and improve customer retention strategies.

The project mimics a real-life client engagement at "XYZ Analytics" and walks through the core stages of a typical BCG data science problem-solving process.
